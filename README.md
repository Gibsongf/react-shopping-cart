[Live preview](https://gibsongf.github.io/react-shopping-cart/)

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React, featuring a pixel game theme inspired by "Dead Cells." Users can explore a collection of pixelated products, view detailed information, and seamlessly manage their shopping cart. The theme adds a unique and visually appealing touch to the online shopping experience.
